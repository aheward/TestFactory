rSmart's Test Factory Gem
=========================

Overview
--------

This gem contains the basic framework for [dryly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) creating test scripts for the web site that needs testing.

Use it to abstract away from the underlying [Watir](http://www.watir.com) code and create your own [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_language).

With TestFactory you have the ability to...

1. Easily instantiate pages in a consistent manner
2. Concisely describe elements on a page, keeping it DRY by avoiding repetition of element identifiers
3. Provide higher-level methods that use the elements to perform user-oriented functions

Tremendous thanks is due to [Alister Scott](http://watirmelon.com), whose [custom page object code](https://github.com/alisterscott/wmf-custom-page-object) for the Wikimedia Foundation provided the inspiration for this gem.

How to Start
------------

First install the gem, of course.

    gem install test-factory

Now you'll want to start building your own page classes, using the methods in Test Factory as your tool chest.

Please note that the following example is *very* simplified and contrived, to keep every step as compartmentalized as possible. Once you've read through this, it is strongly recommended that you visit an actual repository that is using the test factory.

[Here](https://github.com/rSmart/sambal-cle) is one such.

Begin by creating a BasePage class. This class should have PageFactory as its superclass and define sets of class elements that are generally common across the pages of your site.

```ruby
require 'test-factory'

class BasePage < PageFactory

  class << self

    def header_elements
      element(:main_menu) { |b| b.link(title: "Main Menu") }
      element(:logout) { |b| b.button(value: "Logout") }
      element(:administration) { |b| b.link(title: "Administration") }

      action(:main_menu) { |p| p.main_menu.click }
      action(:provide_feedback) { |b| b.link(title: "Provide Feedback").click }
      action(:administration) { |p| p.administration.click }
    end
  end
end

```

Next, you create classes for the individual pages in your web site. These classes should have BasePage as their superclass, and should declare any of the relevant methods defined in the BasePage class.

```ruby
class Home < BasePage

  # This allows the header elements to be defined once
  # in the BasePage class and then reused throughout your web pages...
  header_elements

  expected_element :title # When the Home class is instantiated (using the Foundry),
                          # the script will ensure that the :title element is present
                          # on the page before the script continues

  # Now you define elements that are specific to your Home page...
  element(:title) { |b| b.h3(id: "title") }
  # and on and on...

end
```

Once you've got a bunch of classes set up for your site's various pages, you're going to want to create "data objects" to represent what goes into those pages. For this, you'll use the module DataFactory. Your data classes should follow this basic structure:

```ruby
class YourDataObject

  include DataFactory

  # Define all the things you need to test about your data object.
  # These are some example attributes...
  attr_accessor :title, :id, :link, :status, :description

  # Your data object has to know about Watir's browser object, so it's passed to it here, along
  # with a hash containing all the attributes you want the data object to have
  def initialize(browser, opts={})
    @browser = browser

    # Put any attributes here that you don't want to always have to define explicitly...
    defaults = {
      :title=>"My Data Title",
      :description=>"My Data's Description"
    }
    options = defaults.merge(opts) # This line combines the defaults
                                   # with any options you passed explicitly
    set_options(options) # This line turns all the contents of the options
                         # Hash into YourDataObject's class instance variables
    requires @id # This line allows you to specify any class instance variables that must
                 # be explicitly defined for the data object
  end

  # Now define a bunch of methods that are relevant to your data object.
  # In general these methods will follow the CRUD pattern

  def create
    # Your code here...
  end

  def view
    # Your code here...
  end

  def edit opts={}
    # Your code here...
    set_options(opts) # This updates all your class instance variables
                      # with any new values specified by the opts Hash.
  end

  def remove
    # Your code here...
  end

end
```

Now you have your basic infrastructure in place, and you can start writing your test cases using these classes.

```ruby
include Foundry # Gives you access to the methods that instantiate your Page and Data classes

# First, make the data object you're going to use for testing...
@my_thing = make YourDataObject :id=>"identifier", :description=>"It's lovely."

# Now, create the data in your site...
@my_thing.create

on MyPage do |page|
  page.title.set "Bla bla"
  # Very contrived example. You should be using your favorite verification framework here:
  page.description==@my_thing.description ? puts "Passed" : puts "Failed"
end
```
